I am a computer scientist / software engineer / founder, currently focused on shaping the future of web app development with 🐝 https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp 🐝 .

While I am a generalist and enjoy learning new languages, currently I am having most of of the fun while coding in Haskell and Javascript.

In my free time I enjoy mechanical keyboards, bodyweight exercise and Rocket League.
